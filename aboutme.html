<h1>About me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>
    Hi! I'm Lucas Guilherme, 23 years old, and I'm currently studying Physics at Unesp. I initially aimed to become a criminal forensics expert through public exams, but taking a course called "Introduction to Computing with Dev C++" sparked my enthusiasm for programming and changed my direction.

    Since I've always enjoyed technology, I decided to explore the IT field further, and I saw Web Development as an excellent opportunity to work with something that truly captivates me and keeps me excited about my job, while also opening doors to international career opportunities. Currently, I'm at the beginning of my Full-Stack Web Development course, where I'm focused on learning the fundamentals of HTML.
 In my free time, I enjoy relaxing by playing video games, reading manga, and exploring books on Stoicism
